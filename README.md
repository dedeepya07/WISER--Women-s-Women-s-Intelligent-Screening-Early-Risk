This project is an AI-powered predictive platform designed to identify the risk of early menopause and perimenopause in women using advanced unsupervised learning techniques. By leveraging key health indicators like age, BMI, menstrual cycle irregularities, stress levels, and family history, the system clusters users into distinct health profiles. These clusters offer deep insights into how women with similar physiological or genetic traits may be at increased or decreased risk of early menopausal onset. The models at the heart of this project—Hierarchical Clustering and Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM)—analyze the multidimensional data without relying on pre-defined labels, allowing the system to uncover hidden patterns and groupings that traditional methods may miss.

The motivation behind this work is rooted in the often-overlooked importance of early detection. Many women experience symptoms of perimenopause years before they’re formally diagnosed, and due to a lack of awareness and personalized analysis tools, these signs can be misinterpreted or ignored. This platform aims to fill that gap by offering personalized, explainable feedback that can inform early medical consultation, lifestyle adjustments, or hormone testing. With the help of data visualizations like dendrograms and cluster plots, users and practitioners alike can explore the relationships between different health factors and better understand their placement within a broader health landscape.

Built using Python, the system makes use of libraries such as Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, and Matplotlib for model development and analysis. While the core functionality is focused on backend prediction and clustering, it’s designed to be easily integrated into frontend platforms like Streamlit or embedded in mobile health apps. The modular codebase ensures that the system can evolve—whether through integration with wearable health data, genetic test results, or electronic health records from clinics.

Looking ahead, the project has potential for significant expansion. Future development may include the addition of real-time risk scoring based on wearable inputs, partnerships with gynecology experts for clinical validation, and enhancements using explainable AI to improve transparency and trust. By combining machine learning, health analytics, and a deep focus on women’s well-being, this project strives to make preventive care more accessible, data-driven, and impactful.
